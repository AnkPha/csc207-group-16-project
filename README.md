## Summary 
TasteMap is a socially-driven restaurant discovery and rating platform designed to help users make informed dining choices based on personal preferences, dietary needs, and trusted social connections.
  
### What Does TasteMap Do?
T#asteMap allows users to search for nearby restaurants using an interactive map. Users can filter their results by cuisine, dietary needs such as vegetarian or gluten-free options, and nutritional information powered by external APIs. The platform also enables users to bookmark their favorite restaurants, leave detailed reviews and ratings, and share these with their friends. By connecting with others, users can view friends’ favorite spots, reviews, and shared recommendations to guide their own dining choices.

TasteMap integrates data Edamam nutrition sources, as well as Google Maps Mapping information, to deliver recommendations that are not only personalized but also accessible and health-conscious.
  
### Why Was TasteMap Created?
TasteMap was created to address a gap in existing restaurant discovery tools. Most platforms focus on generic reviews and popularity rankings but often ignore important factors such as dietary restrictions, allergen sensitivity, and the influence of trusted peer recommendations. Our team recognized the need for a more socially-aware and inclusive dining app—one that empowers users to explore restaurants that genuinely fit their preferences and lifestyle. By combining social features with intelligent filtering and real-time location data, TasteMap offers a more meaningful and personalized food discovery experience.
