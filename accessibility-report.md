# Accessibility Report

## Part A: Principles of Universal Design

### Equitable Use
* Features like dietary and allergen filters provide the same means of use to users with food sensitivities or health conditions, without isolating them from the core experience.
* All users have equal access to core features like reviews, maps, and bookmarking, and no functionality is gated or separated by user type.
### Flexibility in Use
* TasteMap allows users to interact with the app in multiple ways such as searching by text, filtering preferences, or navigating via the interactive map.
* In terms of ways to improve TasteMap for the future, we are looking to add more interactive functions to the map feature so that users can easily use just the map to find restaurants they'd like to eat at. 
### Simple and Intuitive Use
* The app’s interface is minimal and intuitive, with banner buttons like “Search,” “Favourites,” "Profile”, and "Friends" clearly labeled and conveniently placed.
* We are currently working on adding features that better accommodate a wider range of literacy and language skills, including multilingual support. Additionally, we plan to implement effective prompting and feedback during and after task completion to guide users and reinforce successful interactions.
### Perceptible Information
* Essential content such as allergen warnings, star ratings, and navigation buttons are designed to be clearly visible when searching for a new restaurant. 
* We are actively working toward increasing visual contrast between elements to enhance readability for all users, including those with visual impairments. Additionally, we plan to incorporate more iconography alongside text to provide redundant communication modes and improve clarity for users with varying language or literacy levels.
### Tolerance for Error
* Currently, TasteMap does not include confirmation prompts for deletions (such as removing reviews or un-friending users), which presents a risk of accidental actions. In future iterations, we plan to implement confirmation dialogs and undo options to reduce the likelihood of user error and to provide a safety net for irreversible actions.
### Low Physical Effort
* TasteMap minimizes the need for extensive typing or repetitive clicking by incorporating filtering presets and map-based browsing. The interface is designed for quick access, with major actions available within a few clicks.
* In the future, voice input could be implemented to further reduce effort for users with limited mobility or fatigue-related conditions.
### Size and Space for Approach and Use
* This principle primarily applies to physical products and environments, where physical size, reach, and movement are critical to usability. Since TasteMap is a software application, it is not constrained by physical dimensions or mobility-related spatial access. While we still aim to make our interface usable on various screen sizes and accessible across devices, the core concerns of this principle do not directly apply to our program.

## Part B: Target Market
Tastemap's base target market includes university-age people as well as young professionals who are active in urban areas and are always searching for places to eat. These consumers will be either dietary-restricted, active, or seeking social validation when deciding where to eat. The app will also appeal to gastronomes, visitors, as well as people who seek nutritional clarity or safety from allergens. Our mapped view, TTC transit directions, as well as peer-authored review format, make it well-suited for users who want to explore the city in an intelligent, socially connected manner.

## Part C: Demographic Accessibility
Although TasteMap may be made widely available, it cannot currently be made completely accessible to some groups: disabled users, older users, and non-tech users. Since it does not inherently include accessibility features such as text-to-speech, variable font sizes, or high contrast. Based on the social definition of disability, these obstacles are not simply the product of impairments, but rather a choice in what we design for. In not designing with diversity, we risk explicit, concrete harm (e.g., inability to locate allergen-safe products), but also relational damage, making users feel less important, less part of the site. In addition, our present UI and interaction design may be liked by young, tech-savvy individuals, but at the expense of elderly individuals who may use it with difficulty due to tiny print or novel gestures. The relational equity ethics, with Anderson's definition of it, puts relational equity at the centre stage, not only filling a function, but treating each user as an equally contributing stakeholder. In response, inclusive, low-barrier functionality like multilingualism, alternate navigational approaches, and personalisation settings will be included in an attempt to make it more usable for individuals, not just the majority.
